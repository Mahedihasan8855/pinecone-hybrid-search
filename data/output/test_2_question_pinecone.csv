What is the formula for book yield?,"Yield Calculations      •   Level Yield Forecast – the yield is recalculated as of the beginning of each period from the cash   flows corresponding to the forecast rates and beginning of period book. If the instrument uses a   credit model, the credit model is disabled for all periods after and including the calculation   period.   •   Level Yield Flat – the yield is recalculated as of the beginning of each period from the cash flows   corresponding to the flat rates of the calculation period and beginning of period book. If the   instrument uses a credit model, the credit model is disabled for all periods after and including   the calculation period.   •   Level Yield Implied – the yield is recalculated as of the beginning of each period from the cash   flows corresponding to the implied rates of the current period’s end -of-period rates and   beginning of period book. If the instrument uses a credit model, the credit model is disabled for   all periods after and including the calculation period.   •   Constant Yield Forecast – the yield is calculated as of the first forecast date and held constant   for the life of the instrument if no credit model is used. If the instrument uses a credit model,   yield is recalculated each period from cash flows with no credit events after the calculation   period.   •   User Level Yield and User Constant Yield - the security input yield is used or all periods until   remaining discount or premium is exhausted. If the provided yield results in an increase of the   discount or premium (book moves further away from par) in any period, no amortization or   accretion is performed in that period.

"," ### Building Yield Curves from a Small Number of Ingested Points  | **Tenor** | **Value** | |:---------:|:---------:| |    1M    |  1.78%   | |    3M    |  1.91%   | |    6M    |  1.91%   | |   12M    |  1.77%   | |   24M    |  1.69%   | |   36M    |  1.68%   | |   60M    |  1.73%   | |   84M    |  1.80%   | |  120M    |  1.90%   | |  180M    |  2.01%   | |  360M    |  2.09%   |  Yield Curve consists of all the points / tenors.   Rate indices can be of 2 different forms: - **Linked Indices**: Matched to a single point on a curve (e.g., 3M Libor). - **Non-Linked Indices**: Directly inputted or equation-based (like non-maturity deposits).  Rates are essential for: - Assigning rate paid/received on products (liabilities/assets) on new volume. It's generally in the format of ""Rate Index + Spread."" - Calculating the new rate paid/received at each rate reset in the future.  The entire yield curve is used for net present value calculation. The timing of the cash flows is matched with a point on the curve. Missing points are interpolated (e.g., linear, log, spline).

How is ‘net cash flow’ defined?,"**Question**: How is net interest income computed?  **Answer:** Net interest income is computed using the base forecast. The valuation cashflows are generated by using the implied forward rates from the forecasted yield curves on future valuation dates.

","Question: I don't see FTP cash flows under single security, why? Answer:	FTP cashflows are only available for ""cash flow"" type FTP method. Make sure the""Proforma FTP"" box is checked in ""Single Sim"" selected during the single security calculation.

","**Valuation methodology – deterministic cash flows**  • Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)    o Cash flows are generated along the implied forward rates and discounted back to the valuation’s date using the market rates as of the valuation date.       − Single set of cash flows       − Appropriate for any instruments without any rate / path dependent cash flow profile   such as CDs, Government bonds, …       − Not appropriate for instruments with rate / path dependent cash flows profile such as mortgages, MBS, CMOs, call / put bonds, …       − Doesn’t capture the embedded optionality of the instruments • Stochastic Valuation (Option Adjusted Spread)    o Cash flows are generated along multiple rate paths and discounted back to the valuation’s date.    o Each path acts essentially just like the deterministic DCF approach.    o The average of all the DCF value of each path is the market value of the instrument.    o Allows to capture the value of embedded optionality such as cap, floor and ceiling as some rate path will “hit” these values.    o Allows to capture prepayment optionality as each rate path will return different  prepayment speeds.    o Appropriate for Mortgages, MBS, CMOs, …    o Requires a source of market volatility to calibrate the interest rate model chosen (Hull- White, Black-Karasinski, …)
