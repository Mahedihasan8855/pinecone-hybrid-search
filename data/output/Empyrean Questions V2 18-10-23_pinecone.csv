","ALTERNATE BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT VIEWS Sometimes regulatory or analytical reports dictate a structure different that typical of management reports. Then it is useful to be able to “roll up” the primary balance sheet and income statement account lines into an alternate set of total lines that are separate and apart from those of the primary sheet view. Provided the lowest level of detail is available for both purposes it is possible to create both structures within a single Empyrean simulation model. The navigation tree under Model Settings includes branches labeled “Alternate Views”. From this branch the user may create a set of total lines containing their own children and organizational hierarchy in a manner very similar to the creation of the primary hierarchy. New views may be added by clicking the branch ‘Add New View…’ Empyrean automatically names new views, but the user may rename them by right clicking the name. The alternate view worksheet has the following headers: <Base64Image> Alternate totals may be created here (and only here) by setting the “Control” column to “Alternate Total” and giving the new total a valid name and unique mnemonic, account number and parent account number. Accounts from the primary balance sheet, including primary total lines, may be assigned to the new alternate total simply by providing the desired account number and designating the new alternate total as the parent account. Alternate views may not create new primary calculation accounts, only alternate total lines. All basic simulation (non-total) account lines must exist in the primary view. However, unlike the primary view account lines may appear multiple times within an alternate view. Therefore, it is possible for a single alternate view to have, for example, the investment portfolio aggregated by AFS, HTM and MTM and another set of totals within the same alternate view based on repricing characteristics, with each of the primary accounts appearing twice.

How can I apply or remove an absolute  or a rate shock floor?," Question: How can I apply or remove an absolute or a rate shock floor? To apply or remove an absolute or rate shock floor in Empyrean, you can follow these steps:  1. Go to the Rate Indices section in Model Settings. 2. Populate the Rate Indices Editor with the necessary information, such as Name, Mnemonic, FTP TableName, and Rate Shock Floors. 3. In the Rate Shock Floors field, you can specify the rate floor(s) that should be applied to the yield curve in downward rate shock scenarios. 4. The default options for this property are zero and none, but you can also define non-zero floors in lookup tables and reference them here. 5. The lookup table for rate shock floors can include any combination of dimensions, such as tenor, forecasting period, and curve. 6. It's important to note that these rate shock floors do not override user-provided forecast values or affect stochastic income simulation. They are only used for interest rate shocks in an automated Multi-Simulation. 7. Additionally, interest rate index equations are evaluated after the application of floors and are not subject to these constraints. 8. Linked indices have their own cap and floor parameters and are not affected by lookup table floors.

","EXAMPLE OF ALTERNATE SCENARIO – DEPOSIT DECAY STRESS SCENARIO

Let’s consider an example in which deposit decays are stressed up by 125%. 
On the sample model, Base Scenario, prepayment cashflows are generated using the decay rates. 
The decay rates are stored in the lookup tables, which are used by the prepayment models. 
As in the previous example, we would like to alter the values used in the prepayment models 
without altering the Base Scenario values. 
To achieve that we would need to create an alternate scenario and figure out a way to manipulate 
decays using advantages of alternate scenarios. 

1. Go to Manage Scenarios 
<Base64Image>

2. Click on Add 
<Base64Image>

3) Populate Scenario Name, Scenario Number, Mnemonic and Description (Optional). Choose a 
parent in the Parent dropdown (Base in this example). Click on Ok 
<Base64Image>

4. All specifications from the parent scenario (Base) get inherited by the newly created 
alternate scenario (Decay Stress) 
<Base64Image>

5. Create Exogenous Account (make sure to be in the Base Scenario!), go to Model Settings 
<Base64Image>

6. Populate Exogenous Account grid 
<Base64Image>

7. Now that we have created that modifier, we need to incorporate it into our prepay model. 
So, let’s go to the Prepay Models -> Decay Rate Model, in which we would incorporate the 
modifier 
<Base64Image>
<Base64Image>

8. The Factor Index is a scaling factor (multiplier) applied to the base prepayment speeds. Now 
that we have incorporated the modifier into the prepay model, we need to populate the 
value of that modifier. Go to Exog Lines 
<Base64Image>

9. Since our DecayMod is being applied as the Factor Index in the following equation, Rate + 
Rate*(Factor Index), and we want our decays in the Base Scenario to remain the same as 
they were uploaded to the model, then we need to leave DecayMod to be populated with 
0% for all periods to achieve it. Essentially, Rate + Rate*(Factor Index) = Rate + 
Rate*0%=Rate 
<Base64Image>

10. Now, all the changes that we have made in the Base Scenario were automatically inherited 
by all children scenarios, including our Decay Stress Scenario. The main question now 
becomes, how are we going to change the modifier without affecting the Base Case? To do 
that, verify that you are in the right scenario and go to Exog Lines 

11. You will see that the values are at 0%, as they were inherited form the Base Scenario 
<Base64Image>

12. Now, remember that the way the Factor Index is being applied to the rate is the following: 
Rate + Rate*(Factor Index). Since our DecayMod is being used as the Factor Index in the 
prepay Model and we want our decays to be stressed by 125%. Then it means that we are

","Empyrean's model has a structure that incorporates posting accounts. These accounts are designed to retain calculated results, like accrued but not paid balances or retained earnings. It's important to note that this structure does not require forecast values. However, to ensure that the current position is correctly balanced, EOPBook values should be provided in the PASecList table.  For a deeper understanding of the properties associated with posting accounts, one can refer to the ""Posting Accounts"" section in Appendix C. Additionally, Appendix I offers a comprehensive list of associated code values.  Below are the specific details of the PASecList table:  SecID is a text field that serves as a unique identifier for security. AccountNum is a big integer data type, which provides a mapping between the security and a specific account in the chart. EntityID is a text field that maps an instrument to an entity. In cases where values are missing, they default to a predefined ""EntityID"" list. InterCompanyID is a text field that identifies the counterpart of intercompany instruments. CurrBook, represented as a double, details the book balance as of the current position date. MktVal is another double data type, showcasing the market value of the posting account at the current position date. BUDAccountNum is a big integer, vital for Budgeting & Planning processes. This number is especially important when exporting results for a matching purpose if there are discrepancies in the charts. DeptCode is a text field representing the Department Code. It's used in the Budgeting & Planning phase to ensure that results are accurately mapped to the respective departments.

How can I display implied forward yields in Empyrean?,"IMPLIED FORWARD YIELDS

When a simulation requires the forecasted rates to be the implied forward yields these may be manually entered by the user via the yield curve editor. However, Empyrean provides a means of calculating the implied forward yield curves and populating and replacing the existing forecast rates with these values. The Implied Yields button on the Utility menu tab brings up the dialog box shown at the right. Clicking on a yield curve from the list will mark or unmark the item(s) for inclusion in the calculations.

<Base64Image>

Next, select the date Empyrean will use as the source yield curve for each of the selected curves. Indicate how far out to compute the forward curves. In each forward month, a new implied forward curve will be created on the day of the month indicated on this form. Note that all forward curves have monthly intervals and the first is one month into the future. The ""Day of Month for Forwards"" simply indicates the associated day and does not change the length of the first interval.

The Calculate button activates the procedure with the calculated yield curves automatically added to the collection of curves. All existing curves after the source date will be deleted and replaced with the calculated implied forward curves.

How can I load external cashflows?,"Question:  How can I load external Cashflows? Answer: Occasionally it may be advantageous to wrest control of the cash flows and valuation away from Empyrean and turn it over to an external simulator that can compute the results for incorporation into an Empyrean simulation. One such case could be where the calculations are overly complex or where the external engine is exceedingly sluggish and yet the values, once they are known, do not change. One such case might be CMOs at the current position, once the rate environment has been determined, or where the accounting results are known in advance. The EXTRA class (External Results Add-in) forces Empyrean to bypass its internal calculators in favor of cash flows, accruals, and market values in an external database for every combination of scenarios and run numbers needed. The connection to this EXTRA database is given in the model specifications database table ‘sLocations’. It has three tables for results: “CashFlowValues”, ‘PeriodicValues’ and ‘RunoffValues’. The EXTRA database table structures are outlined in the Appendix E . The following three paragraphs explain the differences in the three tables and how they are used in Empyrean. The EXTRA Data Type parameter in the EXTRA partitions determines which of these tables are to be used. Periodic Values includes the monthly principal and interest cash flows plus any discount accretion or premium amortization, market value, duration, and convexity. Essentially all calculations are deferred to the external calculator and simply read into Empyrean. Runoff Values are available to accommodate some older systems that don’t use detailed cash flows but rather work with only book and yield simulation results. These older systems did not allow for non-par instruments; therefore, these values should be yield based. The periodic market value, duration and convexity values are also considered to be part of these externally simulated results. Cash Flow Values, on the other hand, give the principal and interest cash flows by calendar date. All future cash flows are income simulation related. Market value, via the price field, duration and convexity are supplied by the user in this table.

","  	THE SPREAD SOLVER - The Spread Solver is a special purpose utility for determining both the OAS spread and the static z-spreads (using the implied forwards) for a known market value. Calculations are instrument level for each security in the fixed income table of the CP database that has a positive market value given in the record. Empyrean employs the user specified partition simulation property parameters to iterate for the spread that results in the known market value. Those values are then written to a model specification database data table for later use during simulations. Spreads may be calculated for all instruments having known market values or only for ‘new’ instruments that do not have a calculated spread. This is primarily useful for mid-month current position situations to preserve spreads calculated at prior month end and only calculate spreads for newly added instruments. Note that the ‘new’ option will also recalculate spreads that have been calculated from model’s current position date. Accounts and partitions that have OAS-Paths as their valuation method will use these security specific spreads derived by the Spread Solver when calculating the value, if available. If not available, either because the Solver has not been run or because there was no market value in the security record to solve for, Empyrean will substitute the partition level spread values specified in the setup. It is also possible to include securities with known values in the Auxiliary section of the chart of accounts and then reference these by their SecID in the “ OAS Linked ID ” parameter to substitute their OAS for those with unknown spreads. Another cash flow discounting method is also available: DCF – Security Level. This method utilizes the static spread values derived by the Spread Solver to value securities in the CP database, again, where CP market values are given. As with the OAS method, if this method is chosen and no value exists for the individual security being valued, the partition specifications for spreads are substituted. Neither the OAS nor the static spread values are part of the security record in the current position database. Rather, they are derived using the Spread Solver utility which writes the security specific values back to the model database table ‘sSpreadData’ as it reflects the security specific spreads derived from the model setup parameters. Calculated spreads may be viewed using the Spread Viewer found on the Utilities tab next to the Spread Solver . In the Spread Viewer, records can be deleted from right-click context menu if needed. Monte Carlo income simulations will always use static spreads in each of its multiple runs, however in a single simulation a switch is provided to force a static rate path evaluation even for those designated for OAS calculations. This is on the simulation startup screen and labeled “Override OAS Calculations”.

How can I update CP Data in the model?,"Question:  How can I update CP Data in the model? Answer: ## **IMPORT DATA TO CP DATABASE**   A convenient option for getting data into the appropriate Empyrean local CP database tables is to collect that source data in either an Excel workbook, a CSV file, or another database, and then use the Empyrean CP Import Data tool on the DB Tools tab to get that data into an Empyrean CP database. Since some of the fields in the CP database are optional or can use settings inherited from their account and partition, the source data need not include an entry for every possible CP database field. Even where imported data exists for a field it is possible to have null entries for some of the records as valid entries. (See the documentation for each CP database table for a list of required fields). The Empyrean CP destination database must have a text field named ‘ImportSource’ in every CP database table (FISecList, NonMatList, ONSecList, etc., listed above). This field serves as a link between the source data and the imported data. The Empyrean importer will automatically fill that field with either the name of the Excel tab, the CSV file name (without the directory path), or the source database table that was the source of the record data. The source data to be imported must conform to the following structure for Empyrean to be able to map the source data into the appropriate destination in Empyrean:  ### **Introduction**: - Collect source data in an Excel workbook, CSV file, or another database. - Use the Empyrean CP Import Data tool on the DB Tools tab to import data into the Empyrean CP database. - Not every CP database field needs an entry.  - Even with data for a field, null entries are valid.  - Every CP database table must have a 'ImportSource' field which is auto-filled by Empyrean based on the source.  ### **Source Data Structure**: 1. **Account Number Based Tables**:     - Excel: Headers in the first row. Header names must match CP database table field names. Must have an ‘AccountNum’ column.     - CSV: Same as Excel but comma-delimited.     - Database: Field names must match CP database table field names. Must have an ‘AccountNum’ field.  2. **Security ID Based Tables**:     - (Refers to tables like “OptionSchedule”, “ScheduleCFs”, “PeriodicValules”, “RunoffValues”, “CashFlowValues”)     - Excel: Headers in the first row. Header names must match CP database table field names. Must have a ‘SecID’ column.     - CSV: Same as Excel but comma-delimited.     - Database: Field names must match CP database table field names. Must have a ‘SecID’ field.  3. **EXTRA Map Table**:     - The “MapValues” table in EXTRA can also be imported.     - Source data should match the mapping table destination.     - To import, users must be signed onto a model. This allows for intelligent mapping to the appropriate CP database table.  ### **Additional Information**: - Source data can include any CP database field or even those not part of Empyrean's system. - Empyrean will skip fields during an import if they don’t exist in the CP database. - Content of source data must match the destination field characteristics in the database. - Any mismatch like trying to import text where numbers are expected will cause import failures and generate errors.

","MAINTAIN DATABASE

<Base64Image>

Model datasets contain references to the current position date and the number of forecast periods to be allocated space for simulations, the number of historical periods to hold, as well as the user’s forecast targets and assumptions. To modify these values, Empyrean provides a Maintain Database tool accessed from the DB Tools tab. These actions are made directly to the model database. Therefore, to use this tool all edits made to the dataset that have not been saved must first be committed to the database or permanently discarded.

The Maximum Forecast Periods value allocates space for a potential forecast horizon. Actual simulation periods are specified each time a simulation is performed and may be less than the allocated maximum. Reserving unnecessarily large space simply wastes computer resources and may impede performance.

No. of Historical Periods determines how many months of historical data are held in the model database. When changing CP Date, certain values from the Existing CP Date are copied into the new historical periods.

Shared Data Maintenance is for maintenance of those items which are common to all the forecast scenarios: historical interest rates, individual instrument spreads, and old change log entries.

The Scenario Maintenance section provides a convenient means of cleaning out forecast assumptions or simulation results from the model database for any or all the forecast scenarios. This action often accompanies rolling the model forward to a new current position date but may be used any time to reset forecast assumption values in the model or to clear results, even if the current position date remains unchanged. When clearing forecast data, the existing instances and all associated equations may be preserved by setting their values to zero. Setting interest rates to zero will preserve all user forecast dates and any existing equations, and in the case of yield curves, all user supplied points on the curve. Removal of data from the scenario will purge the database of all instances of the data, including any associated equations. Data cleared using this facility may not be recovered once the method is applied.

NOTE: When the CP date is changed in conjunction with clearing interest rates by setting their values to zero, Empyrean will automatically insert a rate reference at the new current position date.

Selection of a mid-month CP date is supported for current position analysis on any date. When a mid-month CP date is selected, the simulation types supported are:

• Key Rate Duration Sims
• Gap Sims
• Single Sims supporting CP only calculations (market value, duration, convexity, WAL)

Rate indices can be of 2 different forms: - **Linked Indices**: Matched to a single point on a curve (e.g., 3M Libor). - **Non-Linked Indices**: Directly inputted or equation-based (like non-maturity deposits).  Rates are essential for: - Assigning rate paid/received on products (liabilities/assets) on new volume. It's generally in the format of ""Rate Index + Spread."" - Calculating the new rate paid/received at each rate reset in the future.  The entire yield curve is used for net present value calculation. The timing of the cash flows is matched with a point on the curve. Missing points are interpolated (e.g., linear, log, spline).

1) Format interest rate yield curves and rate indices based on a, b, and c. The graphic below is an example of how curves and indicies should be formatted. 
<Base64Image>

1. The first column should begin with ""RatesRecast"" or ""Rates"". ""RatesRecast"" only preserves data existing earlier than the 1 value in the range and replaces all other values. ""Rates"" st merges imported values into existing rate data. The following rows in the first column should contain the mnemonic for the yield curve or rate index. A space should be included between yield curves. 
2. The second column should be titled ""Term"". With the corresponding term points in months below. For rate indices the term column should be left blank. 
3. The next columns should contain the date followed by the corresponding interest rates in decimal form. For rate indices equations can also be imported. 

2) Create a named range by selecting Formulas and Clicking Name Manger and selecting new. 
<Base64Image>

This can also be accomplished by selecting our range and entering a name for the range with the formula bar at the top left of the worksheet as shown below in blue. This will save this to the name manager as detailed above.

","EXTRA Amortization Methods Cannot be Used for  New Instruments In version 22.12 we combined the EXTRA partition with the Fixed Income partition, and identified the cashflow import types as an amortization method. During the upgrade from an older version, the partitions are migrated and the amortization method is selected at the partition level. As was the case when EXTRA was a stand-alone partition, marginal volume cannot be created for these accounts, as there would be no cashflows imported to support them. To avoid this error, you can do one of 2 things:    1) Change the amortization method at the partition level to be one of the standard fixed income methods (level pay, straight-line, etc) and    import the EXTRA amortization method in the CP data. This will allow for the current position to use the cashflows being brought in and    new volume to use the partition settings.    2) Direct re-investment volume for these accounts into a different fixed income partition using target volume equations. This is more    challenging and not the preferred way to handle.

How can I create and populate an exogenous account?," Exogenous Accounts - BACKGROUND - Sometimes, additional input variables or metrics are necessary. To this end, Empyrean allows the creation of Exogenous Accounts, which can be manually entered, imported from excel, or calculated based on an equation either before, during, or after a simulation. The following section describes the steps necessary to create exogenous accounts: 1) Click on Exogenous Accounts 2) The Exogenous Account Editor is organized in a similar fashion as the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement Editors with the Name, Mnemonic, AccountNum, Description, Display Order and Calculate Group serving the same purpose, and the following Four additional fields: Group ID (User Defined): Optional group identifier or name under which the exogenous account will be arranged in the data editor for ease of access. Care should be taken that all accounts in any group use exactly the same text as their ID. If groups are used, then accounts that lack a group ID will be arranged together as [Ungrouped].   <Base64Image>    Exogenous Account Editor   <Base64Image> Exogenous Data Editor:  Entity Setting (user defined): Indicates whether the value in an exogenous account is unique by entity or shared across all entities. Display Format (user defined): Controls decimal places shown in the editors. Choose from: Stock, Flow, or Rate (0, 2, and 4 decimal places, respectively). When exporting data from an exogenous account that spans a range of periods, the returned values are summed for flow and averaged for stock and rate. Simulation Order (user defined): Indicates when during a simulation that account’s equations should be evaluated. Select Pre-Sim to have all columns of the account line evaluated at the very beginning of the simulation, Post-Sim for after the rest of the simulation has been completed, or With Forecast to interleave the evaluation of equations by period during a simulation. The following are examples of exogenous lines:In addition to the balance sheet, the income statement, and the optional exogenous lines, a chart of accounts also requires the definition of general posting and balancing accounts. The following steps describe this process:

","EXOGENOUS DATA      During a simulation, it is often essential that variables external to the bank be provided as inputs to the simulation   process. While this can take on many forms, one clear example arises from the regulatory “Stress Test” where   certain macroeconomic variables provide the environment that must be assumed by the bank in performing a   capital adequacy stress test. In Empyrean those variables can be entered as exogenous accounts that can then be   referenced during a simulation.   Exogenous accounts are periodic (monthly) using the same forecast and historical periods as found in the other   accounts in Empyrean, such as the balance sheet and income statement, and must have unique account numbers.   Each period may contain a numeric value or an equation. Where equations are in use, the account must also have   a Calculation Group number. However, unlike other Empyrean accounts, the exogenous account’s equations can   be specified to evaluate before the rest of the simulation begins ( Pre-Sim ), after the simulation is complete ( Post-   Sim ), or the evaluation can be interleaved with the other accounts during the periodic simulation ( With Forecast ).   Post-simulation calculations are available primarily to allow for the calculation of performance metrics such as ROA   or ROE, etc., since their results will have no impact on the simulation results.   Exogenous accounts have three options for entity settings:   •   Shared Input & Results: one set of values exists for all entities. Useful for globally input assumptions such   as macroeconomic variables   62   •   Shared Input: equation values are input once, but results are calculated and stored per entity.   Appropriate for accounts with consistent equations across entities but where calculated results will differ   – such as a loan to deposits ratio   •   Unique by Entity: each entity has a unique set of values. This pertains to inputs and outputs. This option   can be used where equations and results must be unique per entity.   The number and nature of user specified accounts in the exogenous file can be quite large, making navigation   within the table somewhat cumbersome. To assist users in managing their exogenous accounts Empyrean provides   for an optional group identifier, or Group ID , for each exogenous account. All accounts with like group IDs will then   be arranged in the data editor for ease of access. Care should be taken that all accounts in any group use the same   text as their ID. If groups are used, then accounts that lack a group ID will be arranged together as [Ungrouped].   When any group or groups have been defined Empyrean will make those IDs available in a drop-down list in the   Empyrean account parameter editor. To add new group identifiers simply type the new name int o an account’s   Group ID field. Once the new ID has been saved it too will appear in the Group ID drop-down list.

","POST-SIMULATION STAGE      A similar situation exists for Post-Simulation equations for exogenous accounts as for Pre-Sim. (Rate indices are all   evaluated Pre-Sim and therefore are never part of the Post-Sim stage.) Exogenous accounts designated as Post-Sim   have their equations evaluated in Calculation Group at the very end of the simulation after all the simulation   periods have been completed. Post-Sim exogenous equations are useful for generating such things as key ratios,   like equity to assets or ROE and ROA.

What are Global keys?,"KEY SETTINGS - GLOBAL KEYS Global Keys is simply a convenient place for specification and storage of single data points that apply globally across the simulation model. The values available for edit in the Global Keys editor in Model Settings include: • Balancing Account o Asset cash balancing account o Liability cash balancing account o Equity balancing account • Balance Sheet Posting Accounts o Fair Value Comprehensive Income equity account o Earnings credit equity account • Other Miscellaneous Settings o Fiscal year starting month (1-12) o Default yield curve points o Published data orientation (Totals at Top or Bottom) o OAS random rate seed number o OAS number of rate paths o Exclude Unchanged Reset (excludes values in reset categories if rate unchanged) o User interface (UI) indentation of “Total” lines (0 to 9) o Published indention of “Total” lines (0 to 9) • FTP & RWA o Enable FTP features o Enable RWA features The account designations are all integer values – their assigned account numbers. The same is true of the posting accounts on the balance sheet and the income statement. The fiscal year starting month in the editor is selected by the name of the month but is preserved as the month number, between 1 and 12. The default yield curve points included here are used by Empyrean in the creation of new yield curves and then appear in the yield curve editor of that curve as points on the yield curve available for input. The values are 70 expressed as a text string of integer month data points separated by semi-colons and must contain at least three (3) data points to define a curve. Empyrean is shipped with a Global Keys table with the following defaults: 1 6 12 24 60 120 240 360. If the data field in the database is null, then the default values will be substituted. These yield curve term points are also used in a Publish of curves and simulation results. The Global Keys also contain a property that controls the ordering of account lines generated by the Publish option. That property determines whether the total lines appear at the top or bottom of the summation group. The OAS seed number is an integer that is used to seed the random number generator for the generation of random interest rate paths for the Option Adjusted Spread processes. The balance sheet simulation result categories include several that trace the source for interest rate changes in floating and adjustable-rate instruments. Information shown includes the balance that changed rate, and previously associated interest rate and the subsequent rate level. By default, Empyrean includes for any period all balances that were subject to change, even if the rate itself did not change. Global Keys includes a switch to exclude from these balances any volume where the ‘from’ and ‘to’ rates in any period are identical, thus showing only the volume where the rate actually changed and thus resulted in a change to accruals. A complete list of the keys and their content can be found in the Global Keys table description in the appendix on database structures.

","**EXAMPLES OF THE FTP METHODS**  Empyrean uses a variety of methods to generate FTP rates. Here are examples of both cash flow and non-cash flow-based methods:  ---  **CASH FLOW BASED METHODS**  1. **Cash Flow Matched**:    - This calculates the funding rate as a blend of the transfer rate of each projected principal cash flow.     - **Example**:      - Principal Cash Flows over Months: $100, $100, $100, $700      - Transfer Rates: 0.50%, 0.75%, 1.00%, 2.00%      - Calculated Transfer Rate: 1.625%  2. **Time Weighted Cash Flows**:    - This is similar to the above, but the time to each cash flow is a component of the average FTP rate.    - **Example**:      - Principal Cash Flows over Months: $100, $100, $100, $700      - Time to Cash Flow: 1, 4, 7, 12 months      - Transfer Rates: 0.50%, 0.75%, 1.00%, 2.00%      - Calculated Transfer Rate: 1.859%  3. **Weighted Average Life**:    - This calculates the average life of the projected cash flows and selects that single point of the FTP curve.    - **Example**:      - Calculated Average Life: 9.6 months  4. **Modified Macaulay**:    - This calculates the modified Macaulay duration of the projected cash flows and selects that single point of the FTP curve.    - Notation:      - \(N\), \(CFn\), \(r\), \(m\), \(tn\)   \[ \text{Duration} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{CF_n \times t_n}{(1+r)^m}}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{CF_n}{(1+r)^m}} \]  Where: - \( CF_n \) represents the cash flow at time \( n \). - \( t_n \) is the time to cash flow \( n \). - \( r \) is the periodic coupon rate. - \( m \) represents the time from the start date to the cash flow, expressed in terms of the payment frequency. - \( N \) is the total number of payments or cash flows.  ---  **NON-CASH FLOW BASED METHODS**:  1. **Maturity-Reset**:    - Uses months to maturity for fixed rate instruments and months to reset for floating and adjustable-rate instruments.  2. **Rate Index**:    - User specifies an interest rate index as the FTP rate.    - Examples:      - **Simple Interest Rate**: Using a yield curve's one-month point.      - **Monthly Average Rate**: User creates a “Linked Index” specified as a monthly average.         - Examples: Avg5Yr (60 months historical term), Avg1Yr6Mth (6 months), AvgON1Mth (1 month).  3. **Blended Rate**:    - User specifies via an equation a weighted blend of FTP Curve terms and/or other defined indices.    - Example: 60% of Avg5Yr + 25% of Avg1Yr6Mth + 15% of AvgON1Mth.  4. **Variable FTP**:    - An implementation of the Rate Index method, recalculating the FTP rate each month.  ---

How can I stress deposit betas?,"### Modeling Deposit Rates: Beta  #### Graph Overview: - **X-axis**: Timeline ranging from `2000-01` to `2018-01` - **Y-axis**: Values ranging from `-` to `7.00`  The graph provides an illustrative example of beta modeling and showcases three curves: 1. **FFE (Blue)**: Starts high around `7.00` in 2000, dips significantly in the middle years, and gradually rises again towards 2018. 2. **Moving Avg (Orange)**: Follows a trajectory similar to FFE but is smoother, showing the effects of averaging. 3. **Variable Moving Avg (Gray)**: Shows more fluctuations compared to the other two curves, especially in later years.  #### Key Points: 1. **Deposit Betas Variation**: The betas for deposits can differ based on the Financial Institution (FI), the type of product, geography, and the specific customer segment they cater to.  2. **Modeling Techniques**: Commonly, one and two-factor models are used. Some might include time lags or utilize moving averages for better prediction accuracy.  3. **Rate Environments**: Some FIs adjust their models based on the prevailing rate environment. For instance, they might apply different factors (or speeds) for scenarios where rates are rising versus when they are declining.  4. **Book Differences**: Betas for the front book and back book deposits might exhibit significant differences.  5. **CD vs. NMD Betas**: Betas for Certificate of Deposit (CD) are typically closer to `1.0` compared to Non-Maturity Deposit (NMD) betas.  6. **Customer Sophistication**: The beta value can increase based on the sophistication or wealth of the customer. For instance, high-net-worth (HNW) customers may have a different beta compared to mass market customers.

Accruals are treated as compounded interest accounting flows, not cash flows, and are posted on the instrument’s cycle date into the outstanding balance. All cash flows are either increases or decreases in the outstanding balance, controlled using prepayment models and targets. Unlike Non-maturity, Revolver instruments simulate future cash flows and accruals past the end-of-month like Fixed Income. Therefore, each instrument contributes individually to the account’s total periodic outcome, whereas non-maturity accounts assume homogeneous treatment of all balances within a partition each period. Prepayment models, such as FBM (Factor Balance Method), can affect both increases and decreases in the future balances of each instrument to emulate each instrument’s assumed lifecycle. Net reductions in balance, after both principal and interest, are categorized as principal flows (both voluntary and involuntary) with net increases as compounded interest. Where balance increases exceed the compounded interest, the difference is considered a cash flow. Revolving instruments can be fixed rate or floating, and individual accounts can contain both types. Although the life of each instrument is a function of the prepayment table, there are certain financial methods that require a specific calendar termination date – designated here as the Promo End Date. It is used like a maturity date to account for any discount accretion or premium amortization as well as the termination date for deferred interest promotions. Interest rate coupons are set using both an initial rate and, if floating, the subsequent reset rates, with all the techniques and resources available to Fixed Income instruments. Revolvers may also be simulated as non-par instruments, with the limitation that the discount accretion or premium amortization must be done using the Remaining Balance method – a form of the level yield method. Users may find this account type appropriate for credit cards, lines of credit, or even deposit accounts where vintage is a contributing factor in the simulation. The Revolver account was created specifically to handle credit cards with deferred interest features such as “no interest if paid in full” and with merchant discount fees.

The Export Controller is a text string of key value pairs, separated by semi-colons. The left-hand side of each key value pair identifies characteristic of the key as listed below. The left and right are connected via an equal sign. At a minimum, the Controller must contain enough information to uniquely identify the value to be placed in an Excel cell at the intersection of the row and column headers. Valid left-hand side characteristic keys are as follows:

Account – the name, mnemonic, or other designation of specific elements within a group, such as the accounts in a balance sheet or income statement, individual rates among the yield curves and indices, or exogenous accounts.

Category – one of the many categories or properties of an account, such as the average or end-of-period balance, interest accruals, or yield, etc. Categories are designated using their shortnames, such as MktVal and EOPCoupon, or for gaps SGap, LGapPO, or LGapPrepayCF. See Empyrean data references in Appendix B for more. Typically, these short names appear as column headers in Empyrean’s editors. For interest rates the Category defaults to Rate if unspecified. To force exports of end-or-period rates without regard to the period date or period span, use EOPRates as the Category. Categories FTP and EOPFTP are supported to report data from the FTP Historical Rate Database. To export KRD Sim results, use Category=KRD- “Term” to export the market value change from base. To report the absolute market value, use Category=KRDMV- “Term”. Examples include “KRD - 1M” to report the KRD 1 -month change from base or “KRD MV- 10Y” to report the KRD 10 -year market value.

Period – for indicating the date, period number or span of periods to use for data in the Account and Category of the cell. See Import/Export Keywords for ways to designate spans. Integer period numbers convert to beginning-of-period dates when applied to interest rate exports.

Entity – The number (EntityNum) or mnemonic (EntityMn) corresponding to the entity values you wish to export. If a model has multiple entities and an entity row/column is not provided in the export, the ‘current’ entity selected on the HOME tab is used.

Scenario – the Empyrean scenario that is the source of the data to be exported. Scenarios may be designated using scenario numbers or mnemonics. Child scenarios in automated rate shocks are given compound names by Empyrean using both parent and child mnemonics. In scenario names, the value <current> may be used to automatically refer to the current scenario. <Current> is the default value if the Scenario Key is not provided.

Scalar – a multiplicative value to be applied to non-rate categories for transforming exported values.

Term – the secondary designation necessary for yield curves to indicate the intended point on the curve, express in months. Curve interpolation will be applied where necessary.

Indent – when combined with account names this integer value causes Empyrean to pad the account name with the indicated number of spaces. Negative values strip out leading characters in a name.

DayOfMonth – available to indicate a specific day within a month where the period headers are simple integers.

ShowDefaults (only applicable for Settings export) - If set to ‘true’, ‘yes’, or ‘1’, the settings export will write the inherited or default value for any partition value that is not provided. If set to ‘false’, ‘no’, or ‘0’, (the default value), unspecified partition values will export as a blank cell.

ShowNulls (only applicable for Settings export) – If set to ‘true’, ‘yes’, or ‘1’ (the default value to match import behavior), the settings export will write the text ‘NULL’ for any partition value that is not provided. If set to ‘false’, ‘no’, or ‘0’, unspecified partition values will export a s a blank cell.

IMPORTANT: ShowDefaults=true takes precedence over ShowNulls. For example, if a child partition’s AccuralMtd is not set, it will inherit the value of the base partition. When ShowDefaults=true, the child partition export will display the base partition’s accrual method such as US30_360. If ShowDefaults=false, the child partition export will display either a blank cell or the text ‘NULL’ depending on the value of ShowNulls.

ReportType – available to indicate “InstrumentsMV” to export instrument market value results.

The right-hand side of each key value pair indicates the range’s row or column that holds the values indicated by the right-hand side. For range rows use the abbreviation RngRow followed by the number of the row relative to the range, not the worksheet. If the values are in the first row in the range use RngRow1. For values in columns use RngCol. If the accounts are in the second column of the range, it would appear in the Controller as Account=RngCol2. For absolute row and column references, use Row and Col such as Account=ColD; Period=Row4.

In circumstances where the desired account, category, or period, etc. is a constant throughout the range it is possible to assign the constant as the value in the right-hand side of the key value pair. For example, if the referenced period is 12 everywhere in the range, just use Period=12 as a key value pair in the Controller with no column or row header required.

Using the market value method chosen by the user, three market values are generated: the base case market value, the value with the rates shocked up, and the value with the rates shocked down. The duration and convexity (slope and curvature) are calculated as follows:

Effective Duration is calculated using the following formula: <Base64Image>

Where,
i= change in yield
P = Base Market Value
0
P = Market value if yields increase by i

P = Market value if yields decline by i

They are not editable.  LINKED INDICES CALCTYPES  Single Rate:  Represents a calculation from a single date of a linked rate. Utilizes additive spread, caps, floors, and rounding factors. Monthly Average:  Calculates the monthly average of a linked rate. Rate Add, Abs. Cap, and Abs. Floor are used on the linked rate's average, not each individual rate. Daily Compound:  Demonstrates the value of 1.00 from the origination date of a compounded index like SOFR. Formula: SOFR Index = Product of (1 + (SOFR_i * n_i / DaysInYear)) Where: i = Business days SOFR_i = Linked SOFR rate for day i n_i = Days SOFR_i is applied DaysInYear = Day count convention days in a year. Daily Compound Average:  Represents a daily compounded rate over a range of days. Formula: SOFR Average (x,y) = [(SOFR Index_y / SOFR Index_x) - 1] * (360/dc) Where: x = Start date y = End date dc = Calendar dates in the calculation period.

Lag factor sets the start date for Monthly Average and Daily Compound Average. The end date is the evaluation date. Monthly Average type requires Pricing Lag Type to be Month. Monthly Average's Rate Add, Abs. Cap, and Abs. Floor apply to the linked rate's average, not each rate. Daily Compound's Linked Rate should be another index. The rate is requested a day before the calculation date. Daily Compound Average can only link to a Daily Compound rate type.

","### **Valuation Methods:**  **The following are calculations that explain the formula usage behind each of the available conventions.**  ---  **• Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**  - **Purpose**: Utilizes discount information provided in the partition (Discount Index / Spread Index) to calculate the market value of the instrument.    - **Variables**:   - Periodic Cash Flow: `CF`   - Discount Rate (DR): `DiscountIndex + (DiscountSpreadAdd or DiscountSpreadIndex)`    - **Formula**: \[ \text{DCF} = \frac{CF1}{(1 + DR)^1} + \frac{CF2}{(1 + DR)^2} + \dots + \frac{CFn}{(1 + DR)^n} \]  ---  **• OAS – Paths**  - **Purpose**: Utilizes calculated Option Adjusted Spread to calculate market value of an instrument. (Note: Only applicable if OAS is used by the Institution).  - **Variables**:   - Periodic Cash Flow: `CF`   - Discount Rate (DR): `Option Adjusted Spread (OAS) calculated`    - **Formula**: \[ \text{DCF} = \frac{CF1}{(1 + DR)^1} + \frac{CF2}{(1 + DR)^2} + \dots + \frac{CFn}{(1 + DR)^n} \]  ---  **• DCF – Sec Level**  - **Purpose**: Utilizes a spread based on individual market value information provided in the Institutions CP level information. (Note: Only applicable if Spread Solver is used by the institution).  - **Variables**:   - Periodic Cash Flow: `CF`   - Discount Rate (DR): `base rate + Individual Security Spread (implied)`    - **Formula**: \[ \text{DCF} = \frac{CF1}{(1 + DR)^1} + \frac{CF2}{(1 + DR)^2} + \dots + \frac{CFn}{(1 + DR)^n} \]  ---  **Note**: Cash flow generation is sensitive to the environment in which they operate. When using cash flow discounting, the Empyrean calculates and uses the implied forward rates of all the referenced curve as of the valuation date.

"," ### Alternatives for Ingesting Investments and Creating Cash Flows  ---  **Structured Securities:** - CMOs, CLOs, CDOs, ABS and to some extent MBS - ALM systems cannot natively generate cash flows on these instruments - Cash flows are typically provided by a third party via seamless integration or via files from Bond Shops - For smaller portfolios, cash flows can be estimated using “proxy” or “pseudo” instrument types within the ALM system  **Non-Structured Securities:** - Agency Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Municipal Bonds, Short-Term Securities and to some extent MBS - Cash flows are typically generated within the ALM system using standard functionality    ### Investment Security Attributes  ---  **Optionality:** - Callable:   - Exercise date, option frequency   - Reflected in cash flows when provided from an external vendor - Prepayment:   - Direct and seamless link to 3rd party vendor   - Institution supplied   - Reflected in cash flows when provided from an external vendor    ### How to Model “Call Optionality”   **There are 2 ways to model “Call / Put” optionality:** - The exact way:   - Provide optionality characteristics at the instrument level (lockout, frequency, option type, option style, & option price)   - Provide market data (volatility) for calibration purposes   - Use a stochastic valuation methodology  - The approximate way:   - Create a “prepayment model” capturing the optionality by comparing the current coupon and the “refi” rate taking into consideration lockout period, if any   - This is most common way of modeling bonds with optionality at smaller institutions

","Question: I'm forecasting a flat balance sheet, how come my balance sheet is not flat? Answer:	Net Income flows back on the balance sheet as retained earnings. A positive net income will create an asset balancer and increase the size of the balance sheet. A negative net income will create a liability balancer. In this case, the balance sheet will stay flat.

Answer:  Normally for market value calculation Empyrean uses Implied forwards for the coupons when the reset index is based off of a yield curve. This modelling assumption can be overridden in the Valuation section of Non-Maturity Partitions. The field that controls this is titled Coupon Type. Based on what you described, it appears that  you might have have the Coupon Type set to Fixed. As a result, this is might override the implied forward calculation.

How can we apply CP Data filters?,"CONNECTIONS AND USER FIELDS - DATABASE CONNECTIONS <Base64Image> The connection information for databases is not directly editable but rather the Browse button is used to select the desired database. Either the Local CP Data Connection or Dataverse CP Data Connection is required to run a simulation in Empyrean. The EXTRA Security Database is optional and needed only if externally generated cash flows are used in the model. 68 The Local CP Data and EXTRA Results databases are not required to be separate from the model database. For convenience, it may be preferable to place all data in a single database. If no Local CP Data Connection is specified, Empyrean will look to the model database. If no EXTRA connection is specified, Empyrean will look to the current position database. ALM can also connect to Dataverse for current position instruments. Here, the Browse function only brings up Dataverse links for different environments you may have. Both local CP data and Dataverse may be used together. Use cases for both connections include using Dataverse for most instruments but using local CP for non-maturity deposits that are aggregated summaries of detailed deposit data. The Scenario Local CP Data Filter and Scenario Dataverse CP Data Filter are used to limit the instruments queried from the current position database and Dataverse to those that match the filter's criteria. Filters may be scenario specific. During a simulation, this filter will be included in ALL current position database queries as the predicate of a WHERE clause in a standard SQL statement, thereby limiting the records selected to those that meet the criteria. The predicate is identified as: WHERE fieldname = value | predicate | This filter is scenario specific and inheritable by child scenarios. To turn off inheritance in any child scenario, change or erase the filter. As an example, to limit instruments in the Local ALM cp database to those with ""FL"" as the contents of the database field ""State"", the Scenario Local CP Data Filter"" would be: State = 'FL' The FTP Rate History Database is required for CP FTP calculations. Connection information must be specified for this database; it does not default to the model database since its contents are updated each month with new information.

","MAINTAIN DATABASE

<Base64Image>

Model datasets contain references to the current position date and the number of forecast periods to be allocated space for simulations, the number of historical periods to hold, as well as the user’s forecast targets and assumptions. To modify these values, Empyrean provides a Maintain Database tool accessed from the DB Tools tab. These actions are made directly to the model database. Therefore, to use this tool all edits made to the dataset that have not been saved must first be committed to the database or permanently discarded.

The Maximum Forecast Periods value allocates space for a potential forecast horizon. Actual simulation periods are specified each time a simulation is performed and may be less than the allocated maximum. Reserving unnecessarily large space simply wastes computer resources and may impede performance.

No. of Historical Periods determines how many months of historical data are held in the model database. When changing CP Date, certain values from the Existing CP Date are copied into the new historical periods.

Shared Data Maintenance is for maintenance of those items which are common to all the forecast scenarios: historical interest rates, individual instrument spreads, and old change log entries.

The Scenario Maintenance section provides a convenient means of cleaning out forecast assumptions or simulation results from the model database for any or all the forecast scenarios. This action often accompanies rolling the model forward to a new current position date but may be used any time to reset forecast assumption values in the model or to clear results, even if the current position date remains unchanged. When clearing forecast data, the existing instances and all associated equations may be preserved by setting their values to zero. Setting interest rates to zero will preserve all user forecast dates and any existing equations, and in the case of yield curves, all user supplied points on the curve. Removal of data from the scenario will purge the database of all instances of the data, including any associated equations. Data cleared using this facility may not be recovered once the method is applied.

NOTE: When the CP date is changed in conjunction with clearing interest rates by setting their values to zero, Empyrean will automatically insert a rate reference at the new current position date.

67

Selection of a mid-month CP date is supported for current position analysis on any date. When a mid-month CP date is selected, the simulation types supported are:

• Key Rate Duration Sims
• Gap Sims
• Single Sims supporting CP only calculations (market value, duration, convexity, WAL)
• Multi Sims (same options as Single Sims)

i= change in yield
P = Base Market Value
0
P = Market value if yields increase by i
+
P = Market value if yields decline by i
–

Effective Convexity is calculated using the following formula: <Base64Image>

Where the variables are as described above.

Duration is a linear estimate, but convexity is not. Therefore, Empyrean keeps track of each of these market values and accumulates them into the summation lines to enable the calculation of duration and convexity for each total line.

","Question: What rate environment does Empyrean use in the market value calculation?  Answer: Coupons and discount rates are set, or reset in some securities, based on user selected base indices plus spreads that may be a combination of constants and lookup table results, where the lookup table is completely defined by the user. These rates may be further modified by specifying periodic values in the Spread Adjustments table.

how are lease payments calculated in Empyrean?,"LEASES The Lease account class is specific to operating leases from the perspective of the lessor where the institution maintains ownership of the leased asset and collects rent payments from the lessee. Accounting for leases is different than loans since total rent payment is considered as income and the asset is depreciated as an expense. Since a lessee can return the asset at lease maturity, the institution maintains the risk of the value of the asset. PAYMENTS AND ACCOUNTING Lease payments are calculated from the formulas below:  '''𝑝𝑚𝑡 = 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐶ℎ𝑔+𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑟𝑃𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛''' '''𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑟𝑃𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = (𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡−𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒)/𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠''' '''𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐶ℎ𝑔 = (𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡−𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒)∗𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑦𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟''' '''𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑦𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟= (𝐴𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑜𝑛 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡) /(2∗𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟)'''   Operating leases pay in advance. The total rent payment is posted to the Accrued Income posting line for the account. The depreciation expense is posted to Lease Depr posting account. RESIDUAL VALUE RISK Lease contracts specify a contractual residual value which is used to determine rent payments and depreciation, but the lessee does not guarantee this value to the institution the institution maintains the risk of the residual value. In addition, the lessee is not always obligated to return the asset and has the option to buy the asset at the contractual residual value. To model these risks, Empyrean provides lookup tables for both adjusting residual values to assumed market conditions and to forecast an expected return rate (the percent of lease contracts where the asset will be returned to the institution). Unrealized gains and losses are calculated each month. These unrealized gains/losses can also be optionally realized in straight-line fashion over the remaining life of the lease through RV Provision and RV Allowance posting accounts. If not using provision over the remaining life, any residual gain or loss posts at maturity to the account’s gain/los s posting account. PREPAYMENTS If operating leases are prepaid, the lessee is obligated to pay all remaining payments. However, in many cases, collection of these payments is waived in whole or in part. To support this option, Empyrean provides a Prepay Waiver lookup table to model waivers. The finance charge portion of the received prepayment is posted to the account’s Gain/Loss posting account. All lease prepayments are done at a pool level where a portion of the residual value also prepays. Any gain or loss of prepayment due to residual value adjustments are realized at that time. LEASE PROPERTIES All rates are expressed in decimal values. For example, 2.5% is input as 0.025.

","**Question**: What does a principal payment frequency set to ""0"" signify in Empyrean?  **Answer:** If the principal payment frequency is set to ""0,"" Empyrean interprets this as the instrument making no annual payments. Instead, it pays off the outstanding principal amount at maturity. Additionally, if the next (or first) principal payment date aligns with the maturity date or if the amortization method is ""bullet,"" the full principal amount will be paid at maturity.

","Question: What rate environment does Empyrean use in the market value calculation?  Answer: Coupons and discount rates are set, or reset in some securities, based on user selected base indices plus spreads that may be a combination of constants and lookup table results, where the lookup table is completely defined by the user. These rates may be further modified by specifying periodic values in the Spread Adjustments table.

How can I generate implied forward yields in Empyrean? ,"IMPLIED FORWARD YIELDS

When a simulation requires the forecasted rates to be the implied forward yields these may be manually entered by the user via the yield curve editor. However, Empyrean provides a means of calculating the implied forward yield curves and populating and replacing the existing forecast rates with these values. The Implied Yields button on the Utility menu tab brings up the dialog box shown at the right. Clicking on a yield curve from the list will mark or unmark the item(s) for inclusion in the calculations.

<Base64Image>

Next, select the date Empyrean will use as the source yield curve for each of the selected curves. Indicate how far out to compute the forward curves. In each forward month, a new implied forward curve will be created on the day of the month indicated on this form. Note that all forward curves have monthly intervals and the first is one month into the future. The ""Day of Month for Forwards"" simply indicates the associated day and does not change the length of the first interval.

The Calculate button activates the procedure with the calculated yield curves automatically added to the collection of curves. All existing curves after the source date will be deleted and replaced with the calculated implied forward curves.

","Question: Would you be able to explain why the interest on my non maturity deposits does not change in the my market value cashflow calculation? Answer:  Normally for market value calculation Empyrean uses Implied forwards for the coupons when the reset index is based off of a yield curve. This modelling assumption can be overridden in the Valuation section of Non-Maturity Partitions. The field that controls this is titled Coupon Type. Based on what you described, it appears that  you might have have the Coupon Type set to Fixed. As a result, this is might override the implied forward calculation.

Does Empyrean support PSA prepayments?,"ENHANCED LOAN LEVEL PREPAYMENT DATA      It is sometimes possible to improve prepayment estimates by supplying AD&Co with low-level loan specific data.   These are not part of the Empyrean Prepay Model , but rather these values must be provided in the data extract as   part of each instrument’s parameters. These properties are optional  therefore, Empyrean does not require these   fields exist in the CP database. To accommodate any of these optional properties the user must first add them to   their User Fields . Where the user field matches the field name in the following table, Empyrean will pass the value   to the AD&Co model.
